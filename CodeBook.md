CODE BOOK

variales:

volunteers: coded 1 to 30 (original coding was used)

activites: walking, waking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying (originally coded 1,2,3,4,5,and 6, respectively).

feaures: The physical nature of the features and the way the data was processed is descried in the file "features.info.txt" within the data provided 
for this project. From the total of 561 different features, only those with names contain "mean" or "std" (stands, I assume, for standard
deviation), were included, 86 (unique) in total. The origial names were preserved.

Processing: 

the values were grouped by volunteers / activity, and the data points for each volunteer performing each activity were averaged.
